                             \nIf you are logged in with Google, we recommend that you log out and log in again with Google and go directly to deleting the account, this should help in case problems arise\n\n
                             <b>How to change the profile photo?</b>
                             \nIf you want to change your profile photo you must first enter settings and then click on your photo, when selecting the new one click on the check to confirm the changes\n\n
                             <b>I am logged in with Google but I cannot access with email and password</b>
                             \nIf you tried this it is because Google saves you different credentials, it uses your email, but it does not generate a password, but a unique token, so if you created the account with email and password, log in with email and password, if you logged in with Google, use Sign in with Google, credentials between both are not shared for greater security and protection of data and passwords\n\n
